<h2 style="color: cadetblue;">About Us</h2><br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Uni-ball and Uni are brands of pens and pencils,[1] made by the Mitsubishi Pencil Company Limited (三菱鉛筆株式会社, Mitsubishi Enpitsu Kabushiki Gaisha, TYO: 7976) of Japan. The brand was introduced in 1979 as a rollerball pen model, then expanding to the rest of Mitsubishi Pencil products.[3]

  Mitsubishi Pencil Company distributes over 3,000 core products in over 100 countries through subsidiaries, such as Mitsubishi Pencil Company UK. Distribution in the United States, Canada and Mexico is by uni-ball's North American Corporation in Wheaton, Illinois. In Germany they are sold by Faber-Castell, 
  in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East by Hoshan Pan Gulf,[4] in India by Linc Pen and Plastics Limited (LPPL)[5][6], and in the Philippines by Lupel Corporation[7] Despite its naming and the nearly identical logomarks, Mitsubishi Pencil Company is unrelated to the Mitsubishi Group,[8] and has never been a part of their keiretsu.[9]</p>
